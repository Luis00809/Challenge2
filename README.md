# Luis Carbajal Portfolio


## Description
I wanted to make a portfolio page for myself to showcase my previous work. I also wanted to create a portfolio page to test my HTML and CSS skills. While working on this project, I learned that flexbox is a life-saver. This was my first time using the flexbox feature and it helped speed up the process. I also learned that it is much better to use width percentages rather than fixed widths as fixed widths will lead to struggles when using media queries.

## Installation

## Usage 
The created portfolio page can be used by employers that are interested in hiring me. Here,employers can observe my skillset and completed projects. This can also serve as a point of contact as there are listed links to contact me. The page will be used by me in the future as I will continue to update the page as I coninure to complete projects. 

here is a preview of the portfolio page that was created:
